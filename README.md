The [Trimble Modus Design System](https://modus.trimble.com/) describes the UX that Trimble wants to provide in its UI across its many applications. The benefits of using Modus include rapid prototyping, development efficiency, and UX consistency.

Modus includes:

- Components

This library provides Modus Elements as reusable, encapsulated mobile UI components. These can be implemented in any mobile app built with .NET MAUI. The modus-mobile-components library was built using the latest mobile UX specs and guidelines from Figma.

# Looking for documentation?

You can check out [Modus documention](https://modus-mobile.trimble.com) for the library's latest developer documentation.

# Getting Started

### Installing Modus Mobile Components

1. In your dotnet MAUI application, right click on the Dependencies -> Manage Nuget Packages and search and choose the `Trimble.Modus.Components` and click the Add Package
   Hereâ€™s the direct link: [Trimble.Modus.Components](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Trimble.Modus.Components)

1. Add the following using statement in your MauiProgram:

   `using Trimble.Modus.Components.Hosting;`

1. Then register the handlers to use the Modus components

```
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseTrimbleModus()
            // register other handlers
        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

Now you can use the controls in your app.\
